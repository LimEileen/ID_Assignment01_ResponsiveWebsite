# BTS Fanpage

In this website, it is all about a KPOP boyband named BTS. The target user of this website is their fandom and also help more people getting
know of them. In this website, it provided the history and information about the members which can help the fans to learn about them. The users can also purchase their products in this website and check on their upcoming schedules.

 
## Design Process

I decided to create this website is because I'm also one of BTS's fan, I hope this website can help more people to recognise them. The target user of this website is for their fans. If there is a new fan that want to hava a deeper understanding about this group, there is the background of the group and also the introduction of each member in this website. And also, the fans also can purchase some mechndise through this website. In this website, it also provided the group's schedule so that the fans can follow up or get to know about their upcoming events.
 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

Before I start to code the website, I have done a preview wireframe in [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c621ebc5-23af-4efe-8814-ba98e64172e7-9372/).

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp)
    - I have used W3Schools for my social media icon in the footer. 


## Testing
1. Navigation Bar:
    1. The navigation bar is on top of each page in the website
    2. Try to click on one of the title in navigation bar
    3. The website will automatically open the specific page

2. Footer:
    1. Scroll down to the bottom of the website, there are some social media icons
    2. Try to click on one of the social media icon
    3. The website will automatically open the specific social media website in new tab

3. Purchase Button:
    1. Go to the 'SHOP' page in the website
    2. Try to click on the purchase button for the items that want to buy
    3. An alert box will come out to show you are succesfully purchase the item.

This is a responsive website, as the content in the website will automatically respond to the screen size of users' device. As the screen size become smaller than 1180px, the image in the website will place on top whereas the text will place below the image. In the common dekstop screen size, the navigation bar is apply to horizontal. While the screen size become smaller, the navigation bar will apply to vertical.

During testing, I have face many problems especially the content in the homepage. When I change to the small screen size, ordering of the main content and aside will become messy.
